				<div ng-if="card.category == 'Tories'">
					<em>Tories</em>
					<p>A member or supporter of an homogeneous band of wealthy individuals who consider themselves as having a divine 
						right to exert control over everbody else. <q>The best argument against democracy is a 
						five-minute conversation with the average voter.</q><cite> - Winston Churchill</cite>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == 'World Leaders'">
					<em>World Leaders</em>
					<p>Our intrepid leaders. Our brightest and best. Come to lead us into a brighter, more prosperous future. Not this lot. This 
						is a collection of such despotic arseholery that you'll wish you hadn't collected them.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == 'Wrong\'n'">
					<em>Wrong'n's</em>
					<p>This lot defies categorisation. A motley crew of bandits if ever there was one. The only place they belong is far away 
						from civilised human beings. Be warned.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == 'Fictional'">
					<em>Fictionals</em>
					<p>Fake arseholes! Who'd have thought we can contrive even bigger c*nts for fiction than exist in real life? Although 
						that shouldn't be too much of a surprise given the cesspool we have to pick from.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == 'Mouth Breathers'">
					<em>Mouth Breathers</em>
					<p>People who lack the intelligence to breathe through their nose. Their mouth agape appearance thus renders them 
						looking pretty feckless. What's worse is the bile that then spews from this yawning chasm. Some of these fools even 
						combine this with a drool. Which ones? We'll leave that up to you work out.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == 'Attention Seekers'">
					<em>Attention Seekers</em>
					<p>A rag-tag selection of c*nts who either court controversy to cling on to d-rate fame, or commit heinous acts 
						to achieve infamy. We hate them more than the Daily Mail hates liberals.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == 'Sports'">
					<em>Sports</em>
					<p>Ah sport, the great triviality. At least have the decency to pretend you're doing it for the people. These c*nts 
						can't even reach that mediocre target. They cheat, lie, and ridicule themselves whilst basking in the luxury 
						of their immoral wealth.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == '1%er'">
					<em>1 percenter's</em>
					<p>Thanks to these plutocrats, we are now living in the age of austerity whilst the gap between rich and poor is 
						greater than ever. Now you can find out who orchestrated this whole mess. You won't be surprised to hear 
						that they are all still filthy rich and won't be needing the services of a food bank any time soon.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div ng-if="card.category == 'Jokers'">
					<em>Jokers</em>
					<p>These are the special people that help us deal with the torrent of c*nts that we have to put up with. They make 
						us realise it isn't that bad after all. As such they have the power to defeat anyone in the game. Use them wisely!
